# Xmas_get_next_line

**Xmas get_next_line** is a my project for fun. This project will be started at 12/24 and it has to be finished during Xmas.
In this project, I will implement a function named **get_next_line**.

I'm intended to apply some development practice for this project.Recently I'm studying Tidd(Ticket Driven Development) and TDD(Test Driven Deveropment), so I will use these practices in this project.

However, I won't use these practice throughry because I don't understand these practice perfectly.This means I will only use some parts of these practices.
